## **Project Overview:**

This analysis investigates the upward trend in customer churn at Fit.ly Tech over the last two quarters. By synthesizing account data, support interactions, and user behavior metrics, we have identified key indicators associated with churn to inform our retention strategies. Please note that these findings highlight correlations and behavioral patterns rather than direct causal links.
